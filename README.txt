Template use:

DO NOT DETACH MASTER TEMPLATES they control the styling.
The snippets folder in the site folder (cwru template master) has the preloader file so you can add the main image to each html page you create.

TO CREATE AN HTML PAGE FROM A TEMPLATE FILE:

Select: File>new>site templates>cwru Template Master>cwru.master.numberoflinks1-17>create

boom! you have an html5 web page you can edit in editable regions.

When you finish editing the page save it. Test it and do same for all other you want. Link it the same way you would with dreamweaver sites. Add images same as in all dreamweaver sites.

please do not add vw widths to the video iframes. Doesn't work, doesn't help.
